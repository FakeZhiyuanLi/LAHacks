Los Altos Hacks 2022 Hackathon project

This is a garbage classifier using the resnet50 prebuilt image classifier. We sourced over 2000 different images of varies debris, trash, and recyclabes and trained the ai to be up to 70% accurate in our real world tests.

Side note
As the team member who was supposed to upload the code, I made the mistake of trying to take a nap and falling asleep for 3 hours so I ran out of time uploading code. This code was uploaded just a bit before 8, but we were able to submit our code on devpost on time.
